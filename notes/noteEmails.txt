react email integrates with other services like Resend (same team as react email)
https://react.email/docs/integrations/resend
set up the resend api key in the.env RESEND_API_KEY=
npm i resend
you shouldnt really have an endpoint for sending emails
- its more likely part of your business operations, like sending confirmation emails
All email operations should be executed on the server.
