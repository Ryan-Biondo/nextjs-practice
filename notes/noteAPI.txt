create a folder called api - not required, but common convention
- under api we can create our various endpoints ex users, posts, etc
- in any folder or url segment, we can have a page or route file but not BOTH
page file - return markup and HTML
route file - handle HTTP requests

Do a get request, then a post request

create another folder for route with an array to target parameters of a group
- pass props to the route

Export a function for updating it - put vs patch
use put for REPLACING an OBJECT
use patch for UPDATING one or more PROPERTIES

delete - delete an object

Validating requests - can use if statements
but for more complex objects - use a validation library like zod!
 - create a file called schema, export the validation
