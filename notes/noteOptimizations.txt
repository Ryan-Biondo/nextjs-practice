SEO
Lazy loading

Optimize images using image component in Next JS - next/image package
- built on top of standard html img element
- automatically compresses and resizes based on device size
- always use this over a standard html component
- requires src and alt, can import an image an use as an object for src
- often we have to get src from cloud for a user for ex
     -next.config.js can add domains where we are allowed to serve images.
     -for security be specific as possible
     -remote images always require dimensions bc we dont know them ahead of time
        -if not a fixed size, use fill
        -if we use fill, parent element needs a position of relative absolute or fixed

            to keep aspect ratio can use style={{ objectFit: 'cover' }} or contain
        or Tailwind is cleaner - className="object-cover" (or object-contain)
     -can set queries in sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, (max-width: 768px) 50vw, 33vw"
        - only for optimization doesnt impact the size of the image on the screen only how it's serving it on each device.
     -Quality (1-100)
     - Priority - for images that should appear above
images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'example.com',
        port: '',
        pathname: '/account123/**',
      },
    ],
  },

3rd party scripts
To use a service you usualy have to add their script
the next Script component can take a string an interpret it as js
strategy='beforeInteractive' - script loads before nextjs inject any client side code "hydration"
    - only critical and early scripts like bot managers and cookie consent managers
afterInteractive - after the client starts to load (default)
    - tag managers, analytics
lazyOnLoad - after all resources on page have been fetched
    - chat plugins, social media
