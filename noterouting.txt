SPECIAL FILES FOR NEXTJS ROUTING
page.tsx
layout.tsx
loading.tsx
route.tsx
not-found.tsx
error.tsx

Only the page file is publicly accessible
other files are not exposed to the client
use the app directory to co-locate our page files and other building blocks of out project

Dynamic Routes - a route with a PARAMETER
create a folder with [param] with a page.tsx
in order to access route parameters, pass props
- this only works on page.tsx. if its another component, it needs to be passed from the page

Catch-all segments 
- if we have a varying number of parameters, we dont need to create a bunch of nested folders
- instead prefix the folder name w/ ... [...name]
- to make the parameter optional (routing to the base) wrap in double square brackets [[...slug]]
- params

Query String Parameters - a way to pass information to the server as part of a URL
- use searchParams
